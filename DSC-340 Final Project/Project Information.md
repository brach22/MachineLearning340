# Goals:
- Perform a machine learning analysis from start to finish
- Create a written report of your work in the form of a scientific report
- Present your work in the form of a conference presentation

## Abstract: 
Summary of your work in one paragraph. Contain a couple of sentences 
1. introducing problem and why it should be studied, 
2. explaining how you did your machine learning analysis,
3. explaining your results.

## Introduction:
Introduce the problem you are trying to solve and how you will solve it. 
- Explain the data set you are working with,
- Why the problem you are trying to solve is important,
- and details about the machine learning method you chose.

## Methodology:
AKA “Methods” or “Experimental” where you explain how you carried out the machine learning analysis. 
It should be to the level of detail that someone can read this section and exactly recreate what you did. 
- Explain how you formatted and split the data,
- what implementation of the machine learning algorithm you used,
- what hyperparameters were chosen, etc.

## Results and Discussion: 
Present your results from performing your analysis (i.e., how well did the machine learning do) and discuss if this is a good result. You can also use this space to explore and plot the data set if you find this helpful in explaining your results. You can also use this space to discuss factors such as the time taken for the machine learning analysis, changes that had to be made to the methodology to make it work, and any problems you encountered performing the analysis. This section should contain graphs and/or tables with captions to help with your explanations.

## Conclusion: 
The conclusion is where you reflect on whether you could fully solve the problem you set out to do. What are other avenues of research that could be performed using the results you discovered? If you could not fully answer the problem you set out to, what could future researchers do to improve your results?

## References: 
This should be a list of formatted citations for all references you used in this work. 
- in-text citations.
