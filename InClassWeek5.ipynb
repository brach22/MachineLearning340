Decide if you want to use all avaliable information to train your machine learning models or if you want to perform some feature engineering first.  The data set is large (20k+ points), so you can reduce the size of the data set using the `samples` method from Pandas or by truncating the data set to make the remainder of this notebook faster.  Just remember that the fewer points you have the less data the models have to draw patterns from."

In the below code cell, create the best ridge regresion algorithm you can it fit the data.  You can use either the for loop method, Grid Search, or Randomized Search to do the hyperparameter tuning.  In order to save time, restrict the kernel function to just one function.  If your tuning process is taking a signficant amount of time you can reduce the number of points in your data set."
